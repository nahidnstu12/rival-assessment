Full-Stack Developer Assessment


Project: Task Management Application
Build a full-stack task management application with a REST API backend and a connected frontend.

Required Tech Stack
Frontend: Next.js (mandatory)
Database: PostgreSQL (mandatory)
Backend: Go preferred; you may choose another language based on your expertise
Task 1: Backend API
Set up a REST API with the following endpoints:
POST /tasks — create a task (title, description, status, priority, due date)
GET /tasks — list tasks with filtering by status and pagination
GET /tasks/:id — fetch a single task
PATCH /tasks/:id — update a task
DELETE /tasks/:id — delete a task
Persist data in PostgreSQL
Add input validation on all write endpoints
Return proper HTTP status codes and consistent error responses
Task 2: Authentication and Authorization
Implement signup and login using JWT (or session-based auth)
Hash passwords before storing them
Protect all task routes
Ensure users can only view and modify their own tasks
Persist auth state on the frontend (a page refresh should keep the user logged in)
Task 3: Frontend
Task list view with status filter and pagination
Create and edit task form with client-side validation
Mark tasks as complete and delete tasks from the UI
Handle loading, empty, and error states gracefully
Responsive layout that works on mobile and desktop
Task 4: Search and Sort
Search tasks by title
Sort tasks by due date, priority, and created date
Filters, search, and sort should work together
Task 5: Deliverables
Working repository with clear setup instructions in the README
.env.example listing all required environment variables
At least 3 meaningful tests (backend or frontend)
Clean, readable commit history
Plus Features (Bonus)
Role-based access: add an admin role that can view all users' tasks
Real-time updates: reflect task changes live using WebSockets / SSE
Optimistic UI: update the UI before the server confirms, with rollback on failure
Task attachments: allow file uploads on tasks (image or document)
Activity log: track and display a history of changes per task
Dockerized setup: provide a docker-compose for one-command local setup
CI pipeline: set up GitHub Actions to run tests on push
Dark mode: theme toggle with a persisted preference
Submission Guidelines
Time expectation: 3–5 days
